# First part: Several Different CNN models

Download CIFAR10 dataset (.mat) files from official website, put together with these code files. And the name indicates which CNN structure we use. E.g: "resid.m" means ResNet; "deep_resid.m" means Deeper ResNet.

# Transfer Learning in image recognition

Download CIFAR100 dataset (.mat) files from official website, put together with these code files. First run "cifar100_preparation.m" so that it can provide the right dataset, then run "transfer_resid_c100_20categories.m" to play with transfer learning. There is also a file providing code "resid_c100_20categories.m" for training some data in cifar100 from begining without transfer learning.
